This is my first project using github. 
I am still very new to using html and CSS so it was fun to figure out how everything works.
I had to use some workarounds that probably aren't ideal such as using <br> to add top margins because margin-top was taking the div down with it. 
I did not attempt to modify the design based on the screen size so there isn't a mobile design, just the desktop version.  

Here's my [demo](https://lucky-profiterole-8f1b56.netlify.app/)
